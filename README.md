# CSB Project1

## Introduction
Cyber Security Base Project 1 -course repo.
I use in this project OWASP list from the year 2021: https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/
The project is based on backend. 

### How to run the project (on Windows)
This web app is made using Python and Django so therefore you should first read the [installation guide](https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi/installation-guide) so you have installed the required libraries and dependencies. It is used in this course (MOOC Cyber Security Base 2025). 


## Flaw 1: Broken Access Control
Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions ([source](https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)). For example, user has access on viewing sensitive data or performing adminstrative actions, which easily causes security concerns.
